The calculated value of Tv must not exceed the allowable stress (Ta), as shear reinforcement
is just not provided in individual footings for reasons of economy, the same as in solid slabs.
The allowable stress in concrete solid slabs Ta is given by,

 Ta = k . Tc 				(12.16)

Tc is given by Table 19 of the Code depending on the steel area provided for moment at the
critical section 2-2 (the minimum value of Tc is assumed for pt<=0.15 in Table 19 and
k = 1.0 for D >= 30 cm
= 1.1 for D = 25 cm
= 1.2 for D=20cm
= 1.25 for D = 17.5 cm
= 1.30 for D <= 15.0 cm.

Normally, depth of footing given for perimeter shear (Chart 12.1) is more than adequate
to satisfy the requirements of beam shear. But when steel type Fe 415 and Fe 500 are used as
reinforcement beam shear may govern the depth of footing. For stepped footings, additional
checks for moment and beam shear are required to be made for the portion of the footing of
depth Dm (Fig. 12.1 d). When section 1’ - 1’ is the critical section for moment and section
2’ — 2’ is that for beam Shear (Fig. 12.1 d), expreSsions for moment and shear are given as,

For ﬁnding steel area, Chart 4.1 (with y = 0), may be used, as the concrete compression zone
is of a rectangular shape of width equal to B. Shear stress Tv is given by,

T __ YE _ 1.5 82 - 2
v - bd - B . dm ‘ _

and it must not exceed Ta given by equation (12. 16), failing which depth Dm should be suitably
increased. Normally Dm = 0.30 D to 0.50 D is kept in stepped footings and perimeter shear
stress can be checked to be safe by using ﬁrst principles.
