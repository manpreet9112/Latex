INDIVIDUAL SPREAD FOOTINGS	 209

'alpha' = 1.0 for footings of Types (a), (b) and (d) (Fig. 12.1), while alpha < 1.0 for sloped footings of
Type (c). The overall depth of footing is given by,

D=d+c+¢ ...(12.8)

Here, d is regarded as an average value for either steel layer. For sloped footings (Fig. 12.2
b), simple geometry gives,

Chart 12.1 is developed on the basis of equations (12.5) and (12.7) and it applies to both
uniformly deep and sloped square footings. It can also be used for rectangular footings with
rectangular columns by using average values of a and A, provided an equal overhang is left
on all sides of column, which requires,

(b-a) = (B-A) ...(12.9a)
Solution of numerical examples gives an idea that it is possible to develop thumb rules for
ﬁxing depth of footings. It may be noted that there is no dire need of exactness in ﬁxing the
value of depth of footing, only it should be more than adequate for the actions imposed on a
footing. Table 12.1, based on equation (12.5), is developed for footings of Types (a) and (b) (Fig.

12.1). It gives values of D/A for various practicable values of p. It is seen that, for safety in beam
shear, these values are to be increased by 10% in case of steel types Fe 415 and Fe 500. For
sloped and stepped footings (Types c and d), the depth of footing given by Table 12.1 may be
increased by 20%. The depth at the free end of a footing may be restricted to 15 cm, which is
the minimum prescribed by the Code for spread footings.

For footings 0f uniform depth and also stepped footings, the concrete compression zone is
rectangular and charts of Chapter 2 are used to calculate the required area of steel. But for
slopped footings, the concrete compression zone is of a trapezoidal shape and Chart 4.1 of
Chapter 4 is to be used for ﬁnding steel area. Chart 4.1 can be used for both uniformly deep
(gamma = O) and sloped footings. The calculated steel area should not be less than the spec1ﬁed
minimum steel area (Table 11.4 of Chapter 11) for spread footings which may beregarded as
slabs for this purpose. 

Section 2-2 in Fig. 12.3 is the critical section for beam shear. The shear force and moment
