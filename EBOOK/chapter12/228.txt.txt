Individual Spread Footings

 

12.1. Introduction

Clause 34 of the Code gives the provisions governing the design of reinforced concrete
footings. These provisions are similar to those given by the ACI code. The design of footings
in accordance with IS : 456—2000 differs from that by the old code in the following aspects.

(i) Perimeter shear stress must not exceed the allowable value. This aspect was not
given in the old code. But it is similar to the familiar concept of punching shear
stress.

(ii) Bond-stress-criterion was given in the old code, but it is omitted in the new code.
Instead, development length of footing bars is required to be checked at the sections
where bending moment is critical.

(iii) 25% excess pressure on edge of footing was allowed by the old code when a footing
 is eccentrically loaded. This concession is withdrawn by the new Code, thereby
adding to the cost of eccentrically loaded footings.

The Code requires footings to be designed for the following limit states.

(a) Perimeter shear

(b) Bending moment

(c) Beam shear

(d) Development length of footing bars.
(e) Development length of column bars.

12.2. Types of Individual Footings

Individual spread footings can be either square or rectangular in plan, the area of a
rectangular footing with sides A and B being given by, 

(A x B) = P/p (cm2) 		 ...(12.1)

where P is the column load in kN and p denotes the net allowable soil pressure in kN/cm2. In
this development, self-weight of footing may not be considered. This involves only a small error
in that, the weight of the concrete of footing is assumed here to be approximately equal to the
weight of the earth displaced by it. Further, it is assumed here that the soil pressure under
the footing is uniform. This is a reasonable assumption as discussed elsewhere.

The individual spread footings can be of the following types (Fig. 12.1).
