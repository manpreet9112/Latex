INDIVIDUAL SPREAD FOOTINGS 		 213

12.6. Selection of Type of Footings

Footings of uniform depth (Type alpha), though commonly used in practice for reasons of ease
in design and construction, are the costliest. These consume more concrete quantity (about
25% to 45%) than that by sloped footings. This type is suitable only for small footings with
overall depth being restricted to, say, 30 cm.

For footings of intermediate size, sloped footings with slope starting from D/2 away from
the edge of column (Type b), are quite suitable. This type is quite economical giving concrete
and steel quantities quite reasonable in comparison with other types. This type is easy to
design as well as to execute. This type is recommended for most individual footings en-
countered in buildings with overall depth greater than 30 cm. The depth at the free end of
footing may be kept at 15 cm, the speciﬁed minimum given by the Code. The depth (D) of this
type of footing is kept the same as that for footings of uniform depth.

For large-sized footings, sloped footings with the slope starting from the edge of column
(Type c) or stepped footings (Type d) are preferred to other types, as these give the least
quantities for concrete and steel consumption. The stepped footings give the least steel
quantity, while the sloped footings (Type c), give the least concrete quantity. The depth for
these types of footings works out to be about 20% more than that for footings of uniform depth.
Stepped footings are a little cumbersome in construction, while the sloped footings are easier
in execution, albeit a little more labour-intensive than the footings of uniform depth.
