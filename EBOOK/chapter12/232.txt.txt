Fig. 123. Critical sections for bending moment and beam shear in footings.

Beam shear. stress Tv for footings of uniform depth and stepped footings is given by,

Vu 1.5 X 2  2
“C” = --- = —--—-—-—-——

where, b = B for uniformly deep footings,
= a, for stepped fOOtings (Fig. 12.1 d)

...(12.1_2)

For sloped footings, clause 40.1.1 of the Code gives, (-ve sign applies here),

Vu Mu ,

where b’, d’ are shown in Fig. 12.3 (a) and  12.3 (b) and Mu is the ultimate moment at
section 2-2. ' . - ‘ .
