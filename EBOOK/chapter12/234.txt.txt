12.5. Development Length of Bars

Column dowel bars should extend into footings for a distance equal to the development
length (Table 11.3 of Chapter 11) of column bars in compression (or in tension when moment
in column is large). With the clause 26.2.2.2 of the Code, column bars can always be adequately
anchored in the footing, whatever be the depth of footing. '

For development length of footing bars, there should be adequate bar length available (y),
either straight or bent-up or both measured from the face of column. Referring to Fig. 12.4 (a),
for sloped or uniformly deep footings,

y = [ﬁg—a) - 4.0] > La (tension) ...(12.20)

where 4.0 cm is taken as clear cover over ends of bars in footings. If equation (12.20) is not
 satisﬁed, there are two ways to tackle this problem :

(i) bend bars up, as shown dotted in Fig. 12.4 (a)

(ii) choose smaller diameter for bars

For stepped footings Fig. 12.4 (b), the available straight length of bars beyond the critical
section 1’ - 1’ is,



Normally, full steel area required at section 1 — 1 is provided throughout and the steel strength
sigma(s) at section 1’ - 1’ may be less than its maximum value of 0.87 fy. The value of Ld (tension)
should be calculated for the appropriate value of sigma(s).

‘y' = [M — 4.0] > La (tension) ...( 12.21)
