With the area of footing known from equation (12.1), dimensions A and B are easily
ﬁnalised. The only dimension of the footing which remains to be known is the depth (D) of the
footing. A common way of design of footings is to assume D, rather generously, with a view to
reduce steel area as well as to help provide ﬁxity to the column base, in order to be close to the
assumptions made in the frame analysis of superstructure.

12.3. Design for Perimeter Shear

Depth of footing is ﬁxed from the consideration of perimeter shear stress which depends
on concrete quality, being independent of type of reinforcing steel. For a square footing of
uniform depth with a square column of side a (Fig. 12.2 a), perimeter shear stress Tu is given
by

and b0 = perimeter of the critical closed section. 
The allowable perimeter shear stress Ta (clause 31.6.3 of the Code) is given by,
