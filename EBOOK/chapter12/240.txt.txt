218 				A MANUAL OF LIMIT STATE DESIGN

Equation (12.20) gives,

y =[ (215 - 40)/2 - 4.00] = 83.5 cm > 66cm OK

12.8. Conclusion

Provisions of the Code on footings have been applied to individual spread footings, square
, or rectangular in plan with depth uniform, varying or stepped. Design aids are given for ﬁxing
depth of footings and checking it in respect of requirements of safety in perimeter shear.
Procedure for design of footings for bending moment, shear and development length of tension
steel bars is given in detail and examples are given to illustrate it. For a large-sized rectangular
footing, a footing beam in the long direction will be more economical than the traditional
isolated footing. Also, for large square footings, two cross footing beams with a uniform base
slab will make for economy.

Notes :
1. ‘A’ is the average of sides of a rectangular footing.
2. For sloped (type c) and stepped (type d) footings, increased depth given by
the above table by 20%.
