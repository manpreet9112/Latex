\section{Section : Classification of Numbers}
Undoubtedly numbers are the cornerstone of mathematics. There is a huge
literature on the
development of numbers but that is beyond our scope. We directly jump to
the classification
of numbers. Remember this classification looks so obvious or trivial
today but humans took centuries to reach here. Reader should appreciate
this.\\\\
\pic{section1}
Here are some notations to denote the set of numbers :\\\\
 N - Set of Natural Numbers = ${1,2,3,....}$\\
 N$_0$ or W - Set of whole numbers = ${0,1,2,...}$\\
Z - Set of integers = ${....-5,-4,...-1,0,1,2...}$\\
Q - Set of rational numbers =
${...-5,\dfrac{-4}{7},\dfrac{-1}{2},0,\dfrac{1}{2},\dfrac{1}{3},\dfrac{5}{7},4,...}$\\\\
* All integers are rational numbers\\\\
Q' or Q$^c$ - Set of irrational Numbers =
$...-\sqrt{11},-\sqrt{5},-\sqrt{7},-\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}....\sqrt{5},...}$\\
R - Set of real Number.\\\\
A number is said to be rational if it can be written as $\dfrac{p}{q}$ form where
p, q are integers. For example
$\dfrac{1}{2},\dfrac{-1}{5},\dfrac{1}{-5},-\dfrac{2}{7},-1,0$,
$4,-\dfrac{7}{8}$
are rational numbers. A real number is said to be irrational if it is
not rational. For example
$\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5},-\sqrt{2},\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$,
$-\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}}$
are irrational number. (It is very interesting to prove that
$\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}$ etc cannot be written as $\dfrac{p}{q}$ form. We
shall prove this shortly).

\section{Section : Non-terminating and recurring rational number}
There are rational numbers such that when we try to express them in
decimal form by
division method, we find that no matter how long we divide there is
always a remainder. In
other words, the division process never comes to an end. This is due to
the reason that in the
division process the remainder starts repeating after a certain number
of steps. In such cases,
a digit of a block of digits repeats itself. For example,
0.3333...,0.1666666...,
0.123123123...., 1.2692307692307692307...etc. Such decimals are called
non-terminating
repeating decimals or non-terminating recurring decimals. These decimal
numbers are
represented by putting a bar over the first block of the repeating part
and omit the other
repeating blocks. Thus, we write 0.33333... = 0.3, 0.16666... =
$\overline{0.16}$, 0.123123123 ..... = $\overline{0.123}$ and
1.26923076923076292307... = $\overline{1.2692307}$.\\\\
Fact : Every non terminating and recurring number is a rational
number.\\\\

\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

\section{Section :
Proof by Contradiction (Irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$)}
We will discuss this topic more thoroughly in the chapter ‘Mathematical
Logic’. Currently
our main motive is to prove the irrationality of $\sqrt{2} i.e \sqrt{2}$
can’t be written as $\dfrac{p}{q}$ form. This
method ‘proof by contradiction’ is used frequently in calculus, one of
the most interesting
branch of mathematics. In this method we assume the negation of
something which is to beproved then use deduce a contradiction which
implies that our assumption was wrong. Now let’s prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is an
irrational number.\\\\
Assume that $\sqrt{2}$ is an rational number it means it can be written
as $\dfrac{p}{q}$
form. Let\\
$\sqrt{2} = \dfrac{p}{q}$\\
Where p, q are co-prime ($p, q$ have not common factor) Now we have\\
$\alpha = \dfrac{p^2}{q^2}$\\
$p^2 = \alpha q^2$\\\\
It shows that $p^\alpha$ is an even integer, since $p$ is an integer it must be
an even integer. So take $p = \alpha m$ for some integer m. Now we
have\\\\
$4 m^\alpha = 2 \alpha^2$\\
$2 m^\alpha = q^2$\\\\
It shows $q^\alpha$ is an even integer hence $q$ is an even integer which
contradicts our assumption
that $p, q$ are co-prime. Hence our assumption was wrong that
$\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number.
$\sqrt{2}$ is an rational number.\\\\

Definition : A prime number (or simply prime) is a natural number $p >1$
whose only positive divisors 1 and $p$.\\\\
Definition : A natural number greater than 1 which is not prime is called
a composite number (or simply composite).\\\\

%\usecounter{subsubsection}
%\subsubsection{}
1)
Solution :\\
Let $x = 0.\overline{4} = 0.444$\\
10 $x = 4.444....$\\
10 $ x - x = 4$\\
$9x  = 4 = x = \dfrac{4}{9}$\\\\
%\subsubsection{}
2)  Solution :\\\\
(i) Let $x = 0.\overline{35}$\\
$x = 0.353535......(i)$\\\\
Here, we have two repeating digits after the decimal point. So, we
multiply sides of (i) by $10^2 = 100$ to get\\
$100 x = 35.3535$... (ii)\\
Subtracting (i) from (ii), we get\\
$100x –x = (35.3535...) – (0.3535...)$\\
$99x = 35$\\
$X = \dfrac{35}{99}$\\
Hence, $0.\overline{35} = \dfrac{35}{99}$\\\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(ii) Let $x = 0.\overline{585}$\\
$x = 0.585585585...$\\\\
Here, we have three repeating digits after the decimal point. So, we
multiply both sides of (i) by $10^3 =  1000$ to get\\\\
$1000 x = 585.585585...$\\
Subtracting (i) from (ii), we get\\
$1000 x –x = (585.585585...)- (0.585585585...)$\\
$1000 x – x = 585$\\
$999x = 585$\\
$ x = \dfrac{585}{999}$\\\\
3) Solution\\\\
(i) Let $x = 0.3\overline{2}$ \\\\
Clearly, there is just one digit on the right side of the decimal point
which is without bar. So,
we multiply both sides of $x$ by 10 so that only the repeating decimal is
left on the right side of
the decimal point.\\\\
 i.e $10 x = 3.\overline{2}$\\
$\Rightarrow 10x = 3+0.\overline{2}$\\
$\Rightarrow 10x = 3+\dfrac{2}{9}$\\
$\Rightarrow 10x = \dfrac{9\times3+2}{9} \Rightarrow 10x = \dfrac{29}{9}
\Rightarrow x = \dfrac{29}{90}$\\\\
(ii) Let $x = 0.12\overline{3}$\\\\
Clearly, there are two digits on the righ side of the decimal point
which are without bar. So,
we multiply both sides of $x$ by 102 = 100 so that only the repeating
decimal is left on the right
side of the decimal point.\\\\
i.e $100x = 12.\overline{3}$\\
$\Rightarrow 100x = 12+0.\overline{3}$\\  
$\Rightarrow 100x = 12+\dfrac{3}{9}$\\
$\Rightarrow 100x = \dfrac{12\times9+3}{9}$\\
$\Rightarrow 100x = \dfrac{108+3}{9} \Rightarrow 100x = \dfrac{111}{9}
\Rightarrow x = \dfrac{111}{900}$\\\\
(iii) Let $x = 0.003\overline{52}$\\\\
Clearly, there are three digits on the right side of the decimal point
which are without bar. So,
we multiply both sides of $x$ by 103= 1000 so that only the repeating
decimal is left on the
right side of the decimal point.\\
i.e $1000x = 3.\overline{52}$\\
$\Rightarrow  1000x =  3+0.52$\\
$\Rightarrow  1000x = 3+\dfrac{52}{99}$\\
$\Rightarrow  1000x = \dfrac{3\times99+52}{99}$\\
$\Rightarrow  1000x = \dfrac{297+52}{99} \Rightarrow  1000x =
\dfrac{349}{99} \Rightarrow  x = \dfrac{340}{99000}$\\\\
4) Solution\\\\
\begin{multicols}{6}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $\dfrac{4}{9}$
\item  $\dfrac{37}{99}$
\item $\dfrac{6}{11}$
\item $\dfrac{23}{37}$
\item $\dfrac{376}{3}$
